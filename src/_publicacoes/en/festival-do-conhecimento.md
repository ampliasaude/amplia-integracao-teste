On 08/31/2022 (Wednesday), members of LabVis and the Amplia Saúde project participated in the [Festival do Conhecimento da UFRJ](https://festivaldoconhecimento.ufrj.br/) with a live thematic panel broadcast on Youtube by @ExtensãoUFRJ.

The panel addressed the environmental crisis and its impact on human health as one of the most important challenges in scale and urgency that we face in contemporary times and which demands from society the readjustment of various aspects of our ways of life.

At the same time, the collection and analysis of public health and environment databases constitute a powerful methodological approach to face the situation, being able to inform public management and promote public policies based on evidence.

We discussed, in light of the actions of the research project “Amplia Saúde: Observatório do Período Perinatal”, the design of data visualizations as a potential tool to integrate, explore and visualize public health data in parallel with environmental data in Brazil.

Check out the thematic panel (portuguese only):
